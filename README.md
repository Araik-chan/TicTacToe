Play Tic Tac Toe Against API

Project Break down: 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
As i have very basic experence with the languages requested, I decided to use a premade base of a Tic Toc Toe game as a reference. 

Reference used: https://codepen.io/thelifenadine/pen/yyXWOJ

Step 1: I Started by working with the reference code  marking the sections where the code would need to be pulled in or cross referenced accourding to the brief. 
Step 2: I worked on the code to play against the API & saving those plays to the database(Text File). 
Step 3: Next i worked on the code to save the winning game to the database(Text FIle).
Step 4: Finally i added the final styling touches and delt with a few bugs. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
What do i need to run code:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
No external connections or references required to run code.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
How do you play the game: 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
You start with a pre-selected symbol "X" 
Start the game by selecting your move , the API will then follow up with its move. 
Repeat until there is a winner.
